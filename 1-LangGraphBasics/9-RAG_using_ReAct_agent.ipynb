      " ### Agent Loop\n",
      "An agent loop refers to the process iterated by AI systems or agents to continuously improve their performance by utilizing feedback from their environment and updating their internal models or strategies. This iterative process allows agents, especially those driven by machine learning, to enhance their ability to perform tasks autonomously over time. The loop typically involves perceiving the environment, taking actions based on current knowledge, receiving feedback, and adjusting future actions to improve outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Autonomous Agents (as described by Wikipedia)\n",
      "According to Wikipedia, an autonomous agent is an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of performing complex tasks independently. Autonomous or intelligent agents perceive their environment and take autonomous actions to achieve specific goals. They can improve their performance using machine learning or by acquiring knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intelligent agents, a subset of autonomous agents, have defined objective functions guiding their decision-making to maximize outcomes. These agents vary in complexity, from simple thermostats to complex AI systems like human beings or software programs performing autonomous tasks. They are studied in AI, economics, cognitive science, and more, highlighting their broad applicability in automating and optimizing processes across various domains.\n"

      "Tree of Thoughts, as proposed by Yao et al. in 2023, extends the concept of Chain of Thought (CoT) by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step of a problem-solving process. Instead of a linear path of reasoning, Tree of Thoughts decomposes a problem into multiple thought steps and generates various potential thoughts at each step, creating a branching tree structure. This structure can be navigated using either a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), with each state being evaluated via a classifier or a majority vote. The approach enhances model performance on complex tasks by allowing for step-by-step thinking and decomposition of large tasks into smaller, manageable ones.\n",

      "Reflexion, introduced by Shinn & Labash in 2023, is a framework designed to enhance agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to refine their reasoning skills. It utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) setup where the reward model offers binary rewards and the action space is augmented to enable complex reasoning steps. The Reflexion framework emphasizes self-reflection, allowing agents to improve iteratively by learning from past actions and mistakes. This is achieved by showing agents pairs of failed attempts and ideal reflections to guide future actions. Reflections are then stored in the agent’s memory to aid in future decision-making processes.\n"

      "BACKGROUND: Obesity affects over one billion people globally and is a leading contributor to chronic disease. For those with clinically severe obesity, metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective intervention for long-term weight loss. However, surgery is often delayed due to systemic barriers, during which time patients may experience further health decline. Low cardiorespiratory fitness is a known risk factor for perioperative complications, prompting recommendations for prehabilitation to target readiness for surgery. Despite this, few patients meet physical activity guidelines, and supervised preoperative exercise programs are rarely offered in routine care. Telehealth-delivered exercise programs offer a promising solution, but evidence of their feasibility, acceptability, and impact in the MBS setting remains limited.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study (BARI-Prehab) aims to assess the efficacy and acceptability of a telehealth-delivered prehabilitation exercise program in improving cardiometabolic health among patients awaiting MBS.\n",
      "METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, we will randomize 48 adult participants (1:1) to either usual care (control group) or a 4-week telehealth exercise intervention. The primary outcome is aerobic capacity (VO in mL/kg/min at the anaerobic threshold), measured using cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Secondary outcomes include resting \n",

      "Summary: In artificial intelligence, agentic AI focuses on autonomous systems that can make decisions and perform tasks with limited or no human intervention. The independent systems automatically respond to conditions to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include software development, customer support, cybersecurity and business intelligence.\n",

      "Summary: Manus (meaning \"hand\" in Latin) is an autonomous artificial intelligence agent developed by Butterfly Effect Technology, a Singapore-based technology startup with operations in Beijing and Wuhan, China. The agent is designed to independently execute complex real-world tasks without continuous human supervision. Launched on March 6, 2025, Manus has been described as one of the first fully autonomous AI agents capable of independent reasoning, dynamic planning, and autonomous decision-making.\n",

      "Page: AI browser\n",
      "Summary: An AI browser is a web browser with integrated artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, such as automatically summarizing web page content or answering questions about it. A more dedicated type is agentic browser, based on the concept of agentic AI, which can even take actions (such as navigating webpages or filling out forms).\n",
      "The two main artificial agent browsers include ChatGPT Atlas and Comet, which both are released in mid to late 2025.\n",
      "As of 2025, this is a recent development in the browser market, including new entrants from OpenAI, Opera and Perplexity. The designation of AI browser also includes established browsers that later added non agentic AI features, such as Microsoft Edge with the Copilot chatbot and Google Chrome with the Gemini chatbot (for Windows desktop users in the US with their language set to English).\n",

      "### Internal Research Notes on Transformer Variants\n",
      "The notes highlight several transformer variants and their evaluations:\n",
      "1. **EfficientFormer**: Achieved 92.4% accuracy on TinyImageNet, optimized for devices like the Raspberry Pi 4 with effective quantization.\n",
      "2. **Longformer**: Used for handling long sequences, noted for latency issues but potentially mitigated by chunk-based hybrid attention.\n",
      "3. **Reformer**: Faced training challenges such as bucket collisions and gradient updates. Strategies like gradient clipping and efficient attention modules were applied.\n",
      "4. **TinyBERT**: Utilized for classification tasks with an 87% F1 score.\n",
      "5. Other experiments include FlashAttention2 integration to improve latency, Chain-of-Thought prompting for better logic task performance, and LoRA tuning to reduce GPU memory usage by 60%.\n",

      "### PubMed Results on Weight Loss\n",
      "A study titled \"Evaluating the Impact of Telehealth Exercise Prehabilitation on Cardiometabolic Health in Bariatric Surgery Candidates\" discusses the need for prehabilitation in patients awaiting metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). This approach focuses on telehealth exercise programs to improve cardiometabolic health and readiness for surgery due to the identified systemic barriers and low cardiorespiratory fitness among patients.\n",
